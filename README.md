# CO2Emission_Forecasting_Project

Business Objective - To Forecast CO2 Levels for an organization so that the organization can follow government norms with respect to CO2 Emission Levels.

Project Architecture - 1.Business Objective
                       2.Data Collection
                       3.Exploratory Data Analysis
                       4.Data Preprocessing

                       7.Model Deployment

Conclusion - 
             We have applied some Time Series Forecasting Models to the given CO2 Emission Dataset.
             After applying some Forecasting Models to the given dataset, we have found that Model ARIMA gives good time series forecasting for CO2 Emission.
             Therefore, we have deployed ARIMA Model on Streamlit Cloud.
